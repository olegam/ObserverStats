# ObserverStats
This iPhone app written in RubyMotion shows basic statistics from a webservice. Such as the total number of user of a service. 


The app was written in half a day and is my very first project with RubyMotion. This demonstrates that for an experienced iOS developer it is very easy to get started writing less code with RubyMotion.
